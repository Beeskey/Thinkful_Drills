1. What's the most expensive listing? What else can you tell me about the listing?

SELECT * FROM sfo_listings
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 1

id: 24650875
Max listing is $10,000,
Full House Victorian: 7500 SqFt, 4 Floors, Hot Tub
Contact: Sarah
Neighborhood: Western Addition
Minimum Nights: 2
Availability: 18/365

SELECT * FROM sfo_reviews
WHERE listing_id = 24650875

Reviews: 4 since 05/09/2018, all positive. 3 for May 2018, one for August.

SELECT * FROM sfo_calendar
WHERE listing_id = 24650875

Calendar: 
I had to start my analysis here with looking at the "availability" column. I wasn't sure what this meant, so I considered a listing
with an availability of 356/365 on the sfo_listings schema. I looked at its availability on the sfo_calendar schema:

SELECT * FROM sfo_calendar
WHERE listing_id=42408

From this, I can see that, starting at row 23 and for the rest of the rows, availability is 't.' While it's a bit more than the 9 days
that should be unavailable, this answers my question of what the 'availability' column represents - days where the listing is active,
not rentals (f) vs vacancies (t).

As for our listing, I notice availability around Thanksgiving and Christmas, with two additional periods in September and October - 
perhaps San Francisco events or other holidays of which I'm unaware. This house is probably just rented out when the owners are out of
and/or know they can charge a premium for use of their home. They adjust prices according to holidays, with Christmas time having the 
highest price.


2. What neighborhoods seem to be the most popular?

This could require us to factor in many variables/columns. My initial throught is to just count listings per neighborhood:
SELECT
	COUNT(*),
	neighbourhood
FROM sfo_listings
GROUP BY neighbourhood
ORDER BY 1 DESC
LIMIT 5;

Output:
"694"	"Mission"
"506"	"Western Addition"
"504"	"South of Market"
"487"	"Downtown/Civic Center"
"385"	"Castro/Upper Market"

But popularity may have more to do with number of rentals. I also want to try and consider the number of reviews per month, to see
how they results compare.

SELECT
	SUM(reviews_per_month),
	neighbourhood
FROM sfo_listings
GROUP BY neighbourhood
ORDER BY 1 DESC
LIMIT 5;

Output:
"1074.3"	"Mission"
"801.25"	"Outer Sunset"
"714.64"	"Western Addition"
"695.38"	"Bernal Heights"
"662.09"	"Castro/Upper Market"

So, the Mission is certainly the most popular, with Western Addition and Castro/Upper Market also falling in the top 5 of both.


3.What time of year is the cheapest time to go to San Francisco? What about the busiest?

SELECT
	AVG(price::money::numeric::INTEGER),
	calender_date
FROM sfo_calendar
GROUP BY calender_date
ORDER BY 1;

The results from this are pretty striking! December and January are by far the cheapest, with dates from only those two months
populating the first 42 rows of the results. The average prices in those rows range from 201.32 to 215.45.

pt. 2: Again, it depends on how we define busiest. If we consider it as a function of how many listings are available, we have:

SELECT
  COUNT(CASE WHEN available='t' THEN 1 END),
  calender_date  
FROM sfo_calendar
GROUP BY calender_date
ORDER BY 1 DESC;

This provides the number of available listings per date, but that may not be the best measure of business, because it doesn't
tell us how many of the listings were actually rented. Results are scattered, primarily in winter with a bit of spread into late fall
and early spring (Nov. to Mar.).
Perhaps a better measure would be number of reviews grouped per date. As the reviews come after a stay, these will be a bit off
but we can take that into account in our analysis.

SELECT
  COUNT(*),
  review_date
FROM sfo_reviews
GROUP BY review_date
ORDER BY 1 DESC;

This is where graphing would come in handy. It looks like predominantly the results are summer/warmer weather months - May through
September appear most often.
This ranking could be of help:

SELECT
  COUNT(*) as reviews,
  EXTRACT (MONTH FROM review_date) as month
FROM sfo_reviews
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY reviews DESC;

Output:
"reviews" "month"
"35054"	"8"
"31631"	"7"
"27744"	"5"
"27542"	"6"
"24397"	"9"
"23696"	"10"

So there is definitely a trend of summer/ warmer weather AirBnB reviews/visits to San Francisco.
