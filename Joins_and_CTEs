1. What are the 3 longest trips on rainy days?
--my initial answer
SELECT
	trips.duration,
	weather.events as events
FROM
	trips
JOIN
	weather
ON trips.start_date::DATE=weather.date::DATE
WHERE events LIKE '%Rain%'
ORDER BY trips.duration DESC
LIMIT 3;


--the solution used a CTE, but when I tried, I got the same result as before:
WITH
	rain
AS (
	SELECT
		DATE(date)
	FROM
		weather
	WHERE events LIKE '%Rain%'
	ORDER BY date
)

SELECT
	trips.trip_id,
	trips.duration,
	trips.start_date
FROM
	trips
JOIN
	rain
ON DATE(trips.start_date)=rain.date
ORDER BY trips.duration DESC
LIMIT 3;



2. Which station is full most often?

SELECT
	COUNT(status.docks_available = 0) as freq,
	stations.name
FROM
	status
JOIN
	stations
ON status.station_id=stations.station_id
GROUP BY stations.name
ORDER BY freq DESC
LIMIT 1;


--The solution used a CASE statement, so I altered mine to get the proper answer...
--I don't understand the thinking behind the Case statement they used
SELECT
stations.name,
COUNT(CASE WHEN status.docks_available = 0 THEN 1 END) as freq
FROM
	status
JOIN
	stations
ON status.station_id=stations.station_id
GROUP BY stations.name
ORDER BY freq DESC
LIMIT 1;

3. Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips starting at that station but ordered by dock count.
--It seems like I got this one OK.

	stations.dockcount,
	stations.name as station,
	COUNT(trips.start_station) as departures
FROM
	stations
LEFT JOIN
	trips
ON stations.name=trips.start_station
GROUP BY station, dockcount
ORDER BY dockcount DESC;

4. (Challenge) What's the length of the longest trip for each day it rains anywhere?
--I was confused about the approach to this, at first I did my join by zip codes, as I thought it was specific to locations
--where it had rained. Once I saw the solution, I removed that in favor of JOIN on dates. I have 2 more rows than the solution, though...
WITH
	raindays
AS (
	SELECT
		date::DATE
	FROM
		weather
	WHERE
		events LIKE '%Rain%'
	GROUP BY date
),
	trippage
AS (
	SELECT
		MAX(duration) as duration,
		start_date::DATE as date
	FROM
		trips
	GROUP BY date
	ORDER BY date
)

SELECT
	trippage.date,
	MAX(trippage.duration) as max_trip
FROM
	trippage
JOIN
	raindays
ON trippage.date=raindays.date
GROUP BY trippage.date
ORDER BY max_trip DESC
;
