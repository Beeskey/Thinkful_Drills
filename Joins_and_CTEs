1. What are the 3 longest trips on rainy days?
--trips.trip_id, duration, start_date
--date, events WHERE events IN ('Fog-Rain', 'Rain', 'Rain-Thunderstorm')
WITH rain
AS (
SELECT
	date
FROM weather
WHERE events IN ('Fog-Rain', 'Rain', 'Rain-Thunderstorm')
GROUP BY date
)

SELECT
	r.date,
	t.duration
FROM rain r
JOIN trips t
ON DATE(r.date)=DATE(t.start_date)
ORDER BY t.duration DESC
LIMIT 3;


2. Which station is full most often?
**I got this, but I need help understanding why I have to use a CASE statement.
**My initial solution had line 30 as "COUNT(status.docks_available=0) as freq" but that seems to have counted all rows of the table

--stations: name, station_id
--status: docks_available, station_id
SELECT
	COUNT(CASE WHEN status.docks_available=0 THEN 1 END) as freq,
	stations.name as name
FROM
	stations
JOIN
	status
ON stations.station_id=status.station_id
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY freq DESC
LIMIT 1;

3. Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips starting at that station but ordered by dock count.
--stations: dockcount, name
--trips: start_station, departures	
SELECT
	stations.dockcount,
	stations.name as station,
	COUNT(trips.start_station) as departures
FROM
	stations
LEFT JOIN
	trips
ON stations.name=trips.start_station
GROUP BY station, dockcount
ORDER BY dockcount DESC;

4. (Challenge) What's the length of the longest trip for each day it rains anywhere?
**I can't tell why I keep getting 94 rows instead of 92 like the solution...Does it have to do with my WHERE events in 'Rain'?

--weather: date, WHERE events IN ("Rain", "Rain-Thunderstorm", "Fog-Rain")
--trips: duration, start_date
--all days with Rain events
WITH rain
AS (
SELECT
	DATE(date)
FROM
	weather
WHERE events IN ('Fog-Rain', 'Rain', 'Rain-Thunderstorm')
GROUP BY date
),	
--highest duration trip per day
trips
AS (
SELECT
	DATE(start_date) as date,
	MAX(duration) as duration
FROM
	trips
GROUP BY date
)
--join CTEs
SELECT
	r.date,
	t.duration
FROM
	rain r
JOIN
	trips t
ON r.date=t.date
ORDER BY date;

**GIVEN SOLUTION**
WITH rainy as 
(
SELECT 
DATE(date) weather_date
From weather
WHERE events = 'Rain'
GROUP BY 1
),
rain_trips as (
SELECT
trip_id,
duration,
DATE(trips.start_date) rain_trips_date
FROM trips
JOIN rainy
on rainy.weather_date = DATE(trips.start_date)
ORDER BY duration DESC
)
SELECT 
rain_trips_date,
max(duration) max_duration
from rain_trips
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY max_duration DESC
